This application process a directory of files and converts them into ngrams of a user specified size.

The menu has 8 options
1. The user can specify a directory for the files
2. The user can specify the ngram size
3. The user can specify a output file path and name
4. Build the ngrams and output to csv
5. Exit the app
6. `whitespaceFiltering` they can toggle the regex that removes all none letter
7. `calculatePercentFrequency` will add a thrid column to the csv with the percentage frequancy that ngram appeared in total
8. `useSlidingNGramCalculation` will slide along the source text moving 1 at a time or jumping the size of an ngram each time

My menu updates to show your current settings and also starts with some reasonable defaults.
